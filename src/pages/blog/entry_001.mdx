In October 2024, I was officially diagnosted with OCD–Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. To give you a brief idea of how it feels, imagine that you are unsure about something in particular (anything), and you have a constant doubt about it, you are constantly unsure if that thing is as you think it is–or could be.

You ask your parents, your friends, other people you trust, for their input–and yet, no answer ever satisfies you. The doubt keeps you paralyzed in place and you cannot get it out of your head for sure. You are heavily distressed and anxious and you don't seem like you will find that **one answer**, that one and only true answer that can finally put you at ease.

And until you finally find it, the anxiety **won't go away**.

## A party of One

I cannot speak for every person that suffers from OCD, but can only share my _own_ experience with it. And for months, I struggled like that. Some intrussive thought would come in, and I would get heavily fixated on it and try to find an answer. It was a common occurrence to look for reassurance on Reddit, or through constant Google searches, or scrolling through many youtube videos, and asking ChatGPT (and an implementation of it named AskAquinas) or DeepSeek multiple times a day.

It was just never enough. No matter how much I searched and thought–it was impossible to feel satisfied. Eventually I would get obsessed with another thought or topic, and that previous obsession would seemingly get lost in the void. Although some very specific topics would remain in the back of my head to _"investigate later on"_.

Back in July 2024, I started to get psychological treatment (psychotherapy). But it wasn't until October that those obnoxious and seemingly perpetual thoughts would barrage me over and over. Until I just couldn't make any progress and my therapist told me to speak with a pyschiatrist–I just could not function properly on my own anymore. I hardly ate food. I stood up until late searching and researching. Guilt and Anxiety felt eternal.

In fact, twice that month I had to ask my superior at work to take the day off just because I could not start my job, the anxiety was so high that I could not function and had to stay in bed all the day.

For those who know something about OCD, you may be wondering, perchance if it is okay to ask me (it is), _"What is your topic?"_. So, the answer for all of those who asked and did not ask is: **Religious OCD**. Also known as _Scrupulosity_.

## Loosing my mind, loosing my sight

Ever since I was a child, I've been Catholic. And was also educated in a Catholic School for the entirety of my school days. It was through the process of Confirmation that I would really practice my faith, however. And would even become a Cathechist for nearly 2 years, I think.

But when it was time for me to prepare to take the entry exams for university, I decided to dedicate full-time to studying–which resulted in me not frequenting the church anymore.

Eventually, I suppose after some months, even after I already made it through and passed the entry exams, I was already away from what I thought was an integral part of my life.

I wanted to share a bit more of background so you can more or less understand where do I come from.

So, 8 years or so passed, and throughout that time... I basically broke. My values changed, my morals and ethics were in a weird place, my way of speaking became _really_ crude and unrefined–to not say, vulgar. And I derailed and derailed into **degeneracy**. Made mistake after mistake.

Eventually, after some events that I will not talk about, I ended up on therapy (out of my own volition). One day after some sessions passed already, I felt so incredibly guilty for specifically one big mistake of mine. So I called, and asked if I could go that day. That's when during that session, my therapist asked me if I was a believer; I said yes. She suggested to me to go down the road and confess my sins at the Church... and so I did.

And that marked the day I returned back to practicing my faith–and this time, do not get off the road again.

September was pretty fine. Landed a job on the field I wanted, got to work remotely which is convenient, I was putting my all into this job and thinking about what I would do as an artist in the future. A bit more of context here: I quit all my old socials in August, a month prior.

Things were going fine. I was practicing my faith more consistently and would visit the Church on Sundays, as I have to. My family had my back. It seemed like, I was starting to put my life in order.

And then October came in. Thanks to this new job, I was presented formally with ChatGPT, and was fascinated by it. One day I was scrolling through my music library and I realized–I am using a pirated piece of software. And for someone that is trying to get back in order and reshape their morals, I quit immediately and got myself Youtube Premium not so long after.

However... this is where things went south. I started to search on the internet: _"Is piracy a sin?"_. This **ONE** question would open the Pandora's Box to a plethora of other questions. The theological war on reddit and youtube is insanely hostile–one person says something, then IMMEDIATELY another one proposes a counterargument. Then you would have posts contradicting each other. People using big words seemingly out of context. Content Creators on youtube trying to explain really intrincate and more complex theological concepts into very short videos only causing more confusion.

The **Information Overload** was so extreme that I got obsessed over the idea of **_"Is this a sin?"_**. I would doubt constantly of my actions and my thoughts. Would get paralized. And since I am a person that is way too curious by nature, I keep asking around. Eventually, this would turn into me obsessively asking ChatPGT (and later, DeepSeek) or flavors of it like AskAquinas or MagisteriumAI, all the doubts I had. I would debate with it, argue with it, fight with it, desperately trying to convine it of my arguments and why they are wrong on their take–but it was all futile. I was convinced of most if not every AI-generated response.

I stopped thinking. I stopped having critical thinking.

I stopped being... me.

And eventualy–I crashed.
